Dataset Description:


Classification Problem (As total rooms/pinpoint locations are 23 so, total classes are 23)
Total Features = 24 (Because we have 24 BLE Beacons)
RSSI values range:
from -50dBm (demonstrating high RSSI close to Access point) to 
-95dBm (low RSSI ~ faroff Access point)
Pre-processing: 
Replace missing values with -100(it shows very weak signal).
