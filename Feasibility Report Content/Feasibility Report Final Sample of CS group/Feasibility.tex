Advertising is very important for marketing purposes to maintain their advertising quality. This can be done by knowing the person’s genuine feedback about the advertisement. In this project we will use a low cost EEG headset for collecting the brain signals of the subjects, viewing the advertisements, that aims in providing the statistics of the advertisement's impact and the likelihood of a person purchasing the advertised product. 
By the analysis of brain signals using the latest methods we will be able to distinguish between different brain waves like alpha, beta, gamma and delta each of them being specific to a certain kind of activity.This analysis will help us provide the statistical trend for a certain kind of advertisement on the basis of various factors. 
This will greatly help the marketing sector of multinational companies to improve their advertising campaign which will bring a revolutionary change in how they perceive their brand.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Overview Of Project}
Advertising plays a critical role in marketing of a product. The ads released by the company represents the product and if not attractive enough or contain any factor disliked by the customer then its reputation can be damaged in an instant. Therefore, one needs to be careful about the customer’s likeness in order to avoid the financial and reputational damage. Every year, a company allocates a specific amount of marketing budget for the evaluation of advertisements realizing its importance in the promotion of a product. So, in order to provide a better and more reliable way to get customer’s feedback and to detect the effectiveness of an ad, an EEG based system for advertisement’s impact assessment will be established using machine learning techniques for automation of advertisement review analysis. In the proposed system, a low cost EEG headset i.e. Neurosky Mindwave Mobile will be used to collect the brain signals including different brain waves like alpha, beta, gamma and delta each of them being specific to a certain kind of activity of the subject viewing advertisements that aims in providing the statistics of the advertisement's impact and the likelihood of a person purchasing the advertised product. Different features like attention and meditation which are used to characterize the experience of the consumer will be extracted by continuously monitoring and analyzing the consumers’ brain activity. Then classification will be performed and results will be generated whether the customer liked or disliked the specific ad. This analysis will help us provide the statistical trend for a certain kind of advertisement on the basis of various factors. It will greatly help the marketing sector of multinational companies to improve their advertising campaign according to the feedback collected from different customers which will bring a revolutionary change in how they perceive their brand.
\section{Background}
Since the very beginning, marketers strive for understanding consumers preferences and what they were thinking in order to make their ads more productive by using traditional approaches. These techniques known as direct observation method include asking customers what they think and collecting data through surveys and focus groups and then its analysis, which require more manpower and has longer cycle in order to accomplish the results. Moreover, asking the person's review is unreliable because may be most of the time the person is not telling his/her genuine remarks. It is also more laborious, time consuming and less accurate. On the other hand, advertisements are considered very important nowadays as a huge amount of money is being spent on them globally. If we take a look at its global statistics, the latest Dentsu Aegis Network Ad Spend forecasts show in 2019 the growth will increase by 3.8\%, amounting to US\$625 billion \cite{b1}. If we look back in year 2016, the advertising global spending was worth \$500billion\cite{b2}.And if marketing expense i.e. research, marketing,etc.then the total worth of industry
becomes \$965 billion. Global advertising spending from 2010 to 2018 (in billion U.S.dollars) is shown in Figure 1 \cite{b3} below:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figure1.png}}
\caption{Global advertising spending from 2010 to 2019 (in billion U.S. dollars)}
\label{Figure 1}
\end{figure}
Therefore, considering the importance of ads, one cannot rely on such traditional techniques and need some advancement.\par
Some current assessment methods also contains indirect inference from observing changes in customer’s behavior after releasing the advertisement which requires a lot of time and also ad campaign has to be launched beforehand which most probably means cost is already at risk. Similarly some techniques like interpreting person's facial expression and inspecting thoroughly their hand–eye coordination are also applied. All these methods have some drawbacks like some are time consuming while other are ambiguous and may lead one to take inappropriate actions to reach the goal. Whereas, directly collecting the EEG brain waves in order to get the customer’s feedback will be less time consuming and will yield more accurate result.

\section{Motivation}
In today’s world, advertising is a huge business. It gives important information in productive and cost-effective way regarding the services and products and is a powerful tool of competition. Therefore, advertising helps the economy to function smoothly by facilitating the entry of advanced and unfamiliar products and new brands into the market. As we already know that consumer’s opinion plays a major role in making an advertisement . Keeping that in mind, Some major aspects that motivated us to opt this project are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The advertising industry in Pakistan is growing anually at a rate of 10-12pc and it worth \$650 million because of continuously emerging urban middle class and increase in consumerism, purchasing power, and an expanding economy \cite{b2}. So, we need some reliable methods to make our advertisements better and avoid the financial risk. 
\item In Pakistan, advertising sector is frequently criticized because of its lack of creativity and detest of the consumers. The need of the hour is to create productive ads according to customer’s likeness as consumer confidence matters the most \cite{b4}.
\item Nowadays, advertising campaigns are represented by creative and productive and ideas rather than expensive brand endorsements. What matters is the material that clicks in customer's minds. Current campaign shows that communications is the important part and gone are the days when you could just make consumer accept an idea by continuously showing it. 
\item Currently, Pakistan is a hot  market for multinationals as it is growing very rapidly and that is why they are increasing the spend on advertsement. TV remains the biggest medium for media spend in Pakistan with Rs30 billion spending. As the country is spending so much in advertising, the ads must be according to consumer’s likeness to reduce the risk of loss.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\chapter{Objectives}
The use of brain signals to study one’s response is a very effective way for analysis. It gives a proper insight to what is one’s behavior and what decision one will make regarding something. 

\section{Industry Objectives}
The success of any product highly depends on its marketing and advertisement analysis is very important in brand marketing. Every year companies set a specific marketing budget for their advertising campaign. People are asked to fill questionnaires in order to record their response regarding their brand or a particular advertisement for their brand. However, such responses are mostly ambiguous, biased and does not help in a fruitful assessment. To overcome this problem, our aim is to use the technique of neuro-marketing and automate the consumer feedback mechanism for analysis of any kind\cite{b6}. It is supposed to guide the marketers to the right product designs and ad messages to boost sales. Many companies like Hyundai, Google, Walt Disney, Microsoft, Chevron etc\cite{b5}. Few of the industrial objectives are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system must allow the analysts to fill in the gaps left by traditional marketing methods.
\item It must help the marketing analysts understand the consumer preferences in order to improve brand quality, advertisements, packaging etc.
\item Our project should focus on the study of brain responses to marketing stimuli which will revolutionize marketing sector of industries.
\item It must be so economical causing the industries to save on their marketing expenses by recording consumers’ response in an effective and efficient way\cite{b7}.
\item System must cut off losses of industries in marketing sector, by making them predict consumers’ response using advanced techniques accurately.
\item Main aim of our project is to develop a system that is cost effective and error free than the previously designed systems which will eventually lead the industrial field to progress\cite{b8}.
\item It must help the industrial sector to make necessary changes wherever required in the product or advertisement beforehand by analyzing consumers’ behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Objectives}
These objectives involve, a comprehensive study of all the research done in the system’s development field and then on its basis, developing a system that can be able to acquire brain signals and classify them in order to predict the results accurately and in turn should be better than the previously designed systems\cite{b9}. Few of the research objectives are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The main objective is to acquire the brain signals in a csv file from the headset to have a closer look at the signals attained and to understand them better.
\item Project’s research is based on correct distinction between different brain signals, representing different emotions and behavior. So initially the research is based on the understanding different signals connected with different emotions. In order to draw conclusions better.
\item The toughest part is the detection and classification of brain signals into different emotions using different classifiers, whichever is more accurate in prediction\cite{b10}.
\item There should be a thorough research, so that the developers must be able to discover new techniques which are more efficient and faster than previous ones.
\item Techniques that are not yet used must be preferre\cite{b20}. Such techniques must be understood properly and used in such a way that they help in the development of an efficient and intelligent system that is able to analyze human emotions more accurately than older systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic Objectives}
Such objectives play a basic role in developers’ career as the goal of this project work is to gain and enhance skills of development and have a deeper insight of this field. 
Few of the academic objectives are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The main goal of this project is to allow the developers learn major areas of computer field more specifically machine learning and signal processing.
\item Developers must learn problem solving techniques in order to solve real world problems that they encounter in their career.
\item The developers should be exposed to new technologies which help them connect with the technological world in a better way.
\item The developers must implement the test and trial method. They must test different techniques and use those that are more suitable for the project. This will also help them in their future works.
\item Practical performance must be worked upon more and more.
\item The developers must practice risk and change management in the course of their project development. Also, they would be able to polish their decisive power.
\item Developers must learn to meet the deadlines. This will teach them professionalism, which will help them in their future jobs.
\item The developers must work as a team and learn to compromise in different situations. They must also learn to work under or as a team lead. This will help them in broadening their vision.
\item They should be able to understand the importance of commitment and should stay committed to their work.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Scope of the project}
The project involves automation of advertisement review analysis.There will be an app for Android based systems. After establishing connectivity,the user will be shown an advertisement of one of the four categories, during which  brain signals of the subject will also be recorded using the Neurosky Mobile 2 headset. EEG data will be stored in a csv file that is specific to each subject. After showing each add, we will ask the subjects to fill in the questioannaires in order to determine subject's response to the ad so to get labeled data. We will then use this labeled and unlabled data to train our model. This will then be classified into two classes, in order to predict whether the ad is likeable or  not. However, we are also determined to achieve the extent to which the subject liked the ad or to which extent one disliked it. The app will not only display per subject values of different levels of emotions but it will also show wehether it is likeable by the person or not.
\newpage
\chapter{Target Audience}
\section{Marketers and Consumer}
Prposed system can be helpful for the company employees who work as marketers in a company in B2B(Bussiness to Bussines) and B2C(Bussiness to Consumer) environments \cite{b21}. In B2B context the marketers are trying to convince a single person and in B2C they want to convince the decision maker in a company. They used the system to adopt persuasive strategy from knowing what is triggering the feeling of satisfaction in the brain shown by application and try to convince them with the proof to buy the product or signing a partnership deal[22] .   

\section{Educational Admministrators}

Administrators in the educational system can used our system to analyze important features related to the learning performance of the student while they are watching educational videos and use it as factors in the adjustment of instructional methods \cite{b23}. That leads to become a better institution and enhance the learning capability of students. 

\section{Researchers}
Researchers can used our system to know the reaction of individuals to make progress in their research in neuromarketing.

\section{General Public}
Fresher in entertainment industry or any person who wants to know the honest reaction of people on their personal created video can use our application. Accordingly make changes and make their work better and this will decrease the chance of failure. 

\newpage
\chapter{Possible applications of work}

\section{Marketing sector}
The proposed system will help the companies to improve their promotional advertisement video and to make it more attractive and productive by giving them response of different customer’s. Therefore, it will eventually upgrade their marketing. 
\section{Advertising industry}
As it is the global industry of public relations and marketing companies, when the proposed system will enhance the advertisements to provide effective information about products and services in an efficient manner, it will be beneficial for the advertising industry as well.
\section{Increase in economy}
In a country where consumer spending determines the long run of the economy advertising motivates them to pay more. So, by playing a positive role in both marketing sector and advertising industry , which provides goods, services and jobs, proposed system will deep down increase the economy of the country.
\section{Entertainment industry}
As the system gives the feedback on a video, it can be used in entertainment industry as well to enhance the music video’s, short movies, different parts of movies or dramas etc. according to the viewer’s taste before releasing them.  
\section{Education sector}
By getting the student’s feedback on online lectures, proposed system can be used to upgrade the teaching methods accordingly. 
\section{Research in Neuromarketing}
In the proposed system, neuromarketing (the use of modern brain science to measure the impact of marketing and advertising on consumers) will be used. So, a person doing research in this field can use the system.
\section{Other}
With some advancements if the proposed system is trained to work without the video then it can be used in the classrooms to get the student’s feedback about teachers or the classroom environment to improve education system and also to enhance a company’s environment by getting employee’s feedback etc. 

\newpage
\chapter{Existing Systems}
\section{Comparison of Existing Researches}
The comparison of all available systems in shown in the Figure 2. In this table, we have mentioned author's name, headset, dataset, methodology, weakness and accuracy achieved. Headset's comparison is made as there are certain systems in which multi\-electode is used as well as single electrode is used, we will prefer to use single electrode because it is more ecnomical and easy to use. Dataset and methodology's are compared to decide which should be precieved further. The weaknesses and accuracies in existing systems shows their limitations, which we will try to overcome in order to achieve more accuracy.  

\section{Drawbacks of Existing Researches}
Most of the existing systems are either using multiple electrode headset or are inaccurate i.e. low accuracy rate. There is an existing application for the assessment of advertisement and it uses single electrode EEG headset but its accuracy rate is too low. The main drawback of existing systems is that they do not have a proper application developed for the measurement of the impact of an advertisement using EEG headset.  Moreover, as no proper application is developed it is nearly impossible to get person’s brain state while watching an advertisement for honest opinion.

\end{figure}


\newpage
\chapter{Problem Statement}
We will be developing a fast, accurate and efficient system to get a person’s feedback and state of brain properly in order to understand what customers are thinking to prevent any negative impact from our advertisement and changing the policies accordingly. 

\newpage
\chapter{Proposed System}
Proposed system consists of four modules:

\section{Headset Connectivity}
User needs to properly wear the headset by placing the single electrode on the frontal lobe and placing the reference electrode on ear lobe and connect it with the system using Bluetooth and ThinkGear Connector.
\section{Data Acquisition}
Brain signals will be acquired in a csv file while the user is watching the advertisement to collect direct response.
\section{Response on advertisement}
As soon as the advertisement finishes the user can view the real response on the advertisement in the form of weather the particular person liked it or not.
\section{Overall Response}
All the individual responses will be collected of a particular advertisement to let the company know whether people liked it or not.
\section{Existing system flow chart}
The flow charts of existing systems are shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5. These are the methodologies of some extising systems which were better than others. We will be using these researches in order to derive our own methodology.

\chapter{Feasibility Study}
\section{Technical Feasibility}

Our project is basically focused on the use of Neurosky MindWave Mobile 2 in the field of neuro marketing. Basically, there is many headsets available in market but Neurosky is the least expensive, easy to use and shows effective result by detecting EEG signals through a single channel electrode(fp1) on the frontal lobe as compared to others. It provides wireless automatic pairing and Outputs 12 bit Raw-Brainwaves (3 - 100Hz) with Sampling rate at 512Hz, EEG power spectrums (Alpha, Beta, eSense meter such as Attention, Meditation, and other future meters and EEG/ECG signal quality analysis (can be used to detect poor contact and whether the device is off the head) \cite{b24}. Further we use Unity framework for the development of our application on android platform and we need Bluetooth connection with headset and ThinkGear connector to connect it. Overall, the project is technically feasible because it uses all the simple and latest technologies.

\section{Operational Feasibility}
In marketing sector of companies, they spend a bunch of money on their advertisements and its campaigns. The success of advertisement can be measured by two ways direct and indirect. Both have their own challenges and drawbacks. Like direct method have questionnaires and focus group who evaluate the questionnaires. It includes the peer pressure, group dynamics that leads to the biase results. While in indirect method they infer advertising impact, product sales and customer interest but all of these are observed after the ad release in market. Also, if, why and how particular an aspect of the advertisement effects the results\cite{b25}. In such condition the proposed system is much easier and helpful to obtain the analysis of advertisement. All they do is to set up an environment in which their subjects wear the EEG headset and watch the AD video. Headset record their EEG signals and our App will automatically formulate the results whether the subject liked the AD or not. Eventually, companies have some authentic results which will be helpful for them to make the advertisement better.

\section{Economical Feasibility}
Marketing is the backbone in the success of the product. If it is good the sale is good and vice versa. There are many cases occur to many big companies that their advertisement was irrelevant, unethical and misleading to the product cause a huge loss economically also they loss their trust \cite{b26} \cite{b27}. Our system provides an economically feasible platform to know the advertisement impact on the users. Other methods as discussed above need a lot of money to hire experts that first made questionnaires and then analyze result from them and to observe the market response after the advertisement is released in the market that has its own drawback that it’s already released and made an impact on the people and eventually we all get is the biased results mostly. In this condition, using a least cost headset\cite{b28} as compared to other with a free Application that you can download easily to know the reaction of advertisement on human behavior will let you know it was good or not\cite{b29} . So, if you use our system then you can change the advertisement at right time to make a right impact on people and to convince them to purchase the product that increase the product sale and eventually increase the company's standard. Also, you will not need expert’s supervision for all of this.

\chapter{Limitations and Challenges in implementation of Project}

During the life cycle of a research based project, there are many hindrances and challenges one faces and it is important to keep note of such limitations and problems beforehand. So that necessary steps can be taken.

\section{Headset Connectivity}
As the headset is a very sensitive device, so one of the challenges is the connectivity of the headset which can be affected by electrical interferences and weak batteries as shown in the Fig. 4\cite{b31}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Table1.png}}
\caption{Wireless Connection Troubleshooting}
\label{Table1}
\end{figure}

\section{Dataset Collection}
The dataset collection of the brain signals while the subject is watching the advertisement is the main challenge.

\section{Brain signal Variations}
Brain signals vary from person to person. So, in order to have accurate results more training samples are needed in order to get reliable insights from the studies. Greater samples require greater time\cite{b32}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Table2.png}}
\caption{Signals and Emotions}
\label{Table2}
\end{figure}

\section{Limited Signal Range}

The work is performed on limited brain signals provided by the EEG headset that are responsible for various emotions. So, the system will be able to perform on only those signals and will give analysis within those boundaries. As shown Fig. 5

\section{Environmental Setup}
Reactions observed in a lab test environment may be somewhat different from the actual buying environment which may affect the results. In other word, it may challenge the validity of the assessment results.
